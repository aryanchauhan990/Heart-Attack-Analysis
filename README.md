# Heart-Attack-Analysis

## Motivation

**Why we need to predict chances of heart attack early?**

1) Early detection of heart attacks is one of the crucial stage to save the life of a person
2) Now-a-days it is become very common in india and even lethal. India have more than one crore cases every year
3) If we can predict the chances of getting heart attack through machine learning it will be great breakthrough in the field of medical science
4) We have the dataset which we can use to predict it to some extent but we need more data and features to make our model more robust


## Dataset Features Available

age - age in years

sex - sex (1 = male; 0 = female)

cp - chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 4 = asymptomatic)

trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg - resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal; 1 = having ST-T; 2 = hypertrophy)

thalach - maximum heart rate achieved

exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping; 2 = flat; 3 = downsloping)

ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

thal(thallium stress) - 0 to 3

Output - 0(less chance of heart attack) and 1(more chance of heart attack)
